**thething**

*thething* is a project aimed to create and maintain an inhouse tool 
for pricing bonds/calibrating curves/converting asset CSV files to 
XLSX and many more hopefully :)

It started as a project in JFace/WindowBuilder but then was simplified
and currently is written with Swing.

**NOTE:** Whatever changes are made to the source, please be sure to be 
Java 6 compliant (legacy support for *finmath*)
